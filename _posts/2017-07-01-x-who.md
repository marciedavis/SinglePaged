I have been singing in barbershop groups for nearly 20 years now, and have been developing software professionally for just over 20 years. I quit my job earlier this year to build this app so that I could access my chorus tracks and sheet music more easily while on the go.  I wanted to share this app with my chorus, [The Song of Atlanta Show Chorus](http://songofatlanta.com), and the rest of the barbershop and choral communities. I hope you find it useful.

I have been singing barbershop for 6 years, and singing along to it for almost 10 years. Along the way I picked up the nickname of "Puppy". Why? I'm excited about everything. Especially Playback Genius! I'm here to show you how this app will improve your chorus life, taking the stress out of accessing your music files throughout the learning process. I'm also here to support any and all questions you may have about Playback Genius!
