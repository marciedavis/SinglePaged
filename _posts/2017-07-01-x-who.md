I have been singing in barbershop groups for nearly 20 years now, and have been developing software professionally for just over 20 years. I quit my job earlier this year to build this app so that I could access my chorus tracks and sheet music more easily while on the go.  I hope you find it useful too.

I take care of everything Marcie doesn't want to do.
